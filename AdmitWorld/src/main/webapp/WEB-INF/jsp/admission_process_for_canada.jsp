							<h2>MBA Admission Process for CANADA</h2>
							<h3>STEP 1:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong><u>RESEARCH</u></strong> on and <strong><u>SHORTLIST</u></strong>
								your list of CANADA MBA programs. For a list of over CANADA MBA
								programs with their approximate tuition cost and <a
									href="gmat" target="_blank">GMAT</a>
								requirement, check MBA in CANADA.
							</p>
							<h4>Our help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will help you shortlist the
								right Canadian MBA programs based on your interest area, career
								plan, short and long-term goals, current academic background and
								scores, budget, more. We provide a list of AMBITIOUS, MODERATE
								and SAFE MBA options for you to select from and help you
								finalize the last list of 8 (sometimes 10) MBA programs.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 2:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong><u>BOOK TEST DATES</u></strong> for your <a
									href="gmat" target="_blank">GMAT</a> and <a
									href="toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a> or <a
									href="ielts" target="_blank">IELTS</a>.
								Generally, students do the research on schools after knowing
								their <a href="gmat" target="_blank">GMAT</a>
								score. We recommend you do it the other way round. Ideally, your
								<a href="gmat" target="_blank">GMAT</a>
								preparation should go alongside your B-School shortlisting.
								Learn it all here about <a href="gmat"
									target="_blank">GMAT</a>, <a href="toefl"
									target="_blank">TOEFL</a> and <a
									href="ielts" target="_blank">IELTS</a>.
							</p>
							<h4>Our help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We coach you for these tests.
								We help you finalize the right test dates and register for the
								same. We help you with shortlisting the right Business Schools
								in Canada concurrently providing you reasons on why you should
								select the specific MBA programs.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 3:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong><u>POPULATE</u></strong> the admission requirements
								including essay questions (or SOP requirement) for each
								University and <strong><u>COLLECT</u></strong> admission
								documents that include <strong>sealed transcript</strong> (from
								your degree college – as many copies as the number of
								Universities you are applying to), <strong>recommendation
									letters</strong> (check STEP 4 below), <strong>CV</strong> (updated), <strong>passport
									copy</strong> (scan – front and last page), <strong>marksheets</strong>
								(all – scan them, may be required at a later date), w<strong>ork
									experience letter (s)</strong>, etc. Check out the full list of
								documents required for applying to Canadian Universities.
							</p>
							<h4>Our help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
								We will populate the requirement for each MBA program that you
								are applying to and will submit it to you in the form of a grid
								for easy viewing with options to keep updating the file.
								Information includes Graduate Admission Link, Online Application
								Link, Deadlines, No. of LORs needed, <a
									href="gmat" target="_blank">GMAT</a>/<a
									href="toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a>
								Codes, Address to post any document, Essay questions, SOP
								requirements, and anything that we feel will be very useful to
								you – saving your time and energy (so that you could concentrate
								more on your main admission process). We will check all the
								documents you are collecting or answer any queries that you keep
								having during the process. Our counselors will provide the
								requisite formats / samples of CV, SOP, essays, LORs, etc. We
								also help you with your credential evaluation (WES).
							</p>
							<h4>Note on Credential Evaluation:</h4>
							<p>Some universities may ask for an “academic credential
								evaluation” or a “course by course evaluation”. This needs to be
								done through WES, as required by the university. You will have
								to send your academic documents to these bodies who, for a fee
								of between CAD$ 245, will convert your scores to the Canadian
								Grading system. They will then report these scores to the
								universities you ask them to for an additional fee.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 4:</h3>
							<p>
								Begin <strong>ONLINE</strong> or <strong>PAPER</strong>
								Applications for each University. <strong>REGISTER</strong> your
								referees online and/or collect the recommendation letters (on
								the letter headed paper of the Company / Institution). Most top
								Canadian B-Schools prefer online method of submitting
								recommendations. You will need to register each referee (using
								their company / institutional email – no yahoo, gmail or
								outlook) and your referees will receive an email with
								instructions to submit the recommendation letter online. Through
								your online application portal, you will be able to see if your
								referee has ‘started&#8217; with the recommendation submission or has
								‘completed&#8217; the recommendation letter submission process.
							</p>
							<h4>Our help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We assist you in filling the
								application forms correctly. We discuss on who should be the
								right referee based on your profile, work undertaken at your
								organization (s), etc. Our experts edit any content that you
								wish us to look at. We check your forms thoroughly and explain
								the plan of action that you need to follow for each University
								application submission.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 5:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> WRITE</strong> your <strong>ESSAYS</strong> or Personal
								Statement. Each University may ask you to write from 1 to 4
								essays. Thus, if you are applying to 8 #BSchools you may end up
								writing about 18 to 24 essays. Many Universities also have video
								interviews, or creative essays (eg. PPT presentation). Essay
								writing will be the longest process. Top MBA programs are very
								keen on knowing YOU well and the better the content of essays,
								the better are your chances of admissions to your dream MBA
								program.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We do limitless iterations to
								the essays. Every essay is checked, reviewed, edited, or
								suggested content is discussed. We keep brainstorming with you.
								Ask any of our students and they will say we help you bring out
								crisp and the finest essays. Canadian essay editing is a two way
								process. You keep sending us the essays and we keep reviewing
								them critically. For creative essays, we come with ideas and
								guide you through the process of creating them. For video
								interviews, we provide mock sessions (over skype, facetime or
								face-to-face). We also help you with your scholarship essay and
								application!</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 6:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> Check</strong> and <strong>SUBMIT</strong> each
								application before the deadline. Your referees should also
								submit their recommendations before the application deadline. <strong>REPORT</strong>
								your <a href="gmat" target="_blank">GMAT</a>
								and <a href="toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a>
								or <a href="ielts" target="_blank">IELTS</a>
								scores online through the testing agencies (eg. ETS, Britsh
								Council, IDP, Pearson Vue). Your Canadian BSchool should receive
								the online score report before the application deadline. <strong>POST</strong>
								your transcript and other necessary documents to the right
								address. (some Universities do not require anything to be
								couriered to them until they have made a decision)
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We check your application,
								find errors (if any) and help you correct them and suggest you
								on the next steps after the submissions. We help you report your
								scores online. We check your documents before they are
								dispatched to the University.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 7:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> FOLLOW UP</strong> with the Universities and ensure
								that they have received your documents and that nothing is
								missing. SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION – some Canadian Universities
								need you to finish a separate scholarship application; so keep
								an eye on it and keep searching for opportunities.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At this stage, it is important
								to keep an eye on your emails and application portals as
								sometimes you may be missing some information. We help you solve
								any issues that come up. Our experts will help you with any
								scholarship or funding applications at this stage. We keep
								sharing any useful information or opportunities that come up.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 8:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> INTERVIEWS</strong>. This is your final step before
								receiving an acceptance or rejection. Most top MBA programs
								require you to attend an interview, which could be over skype,
								telephone call, or sometimes in-country personal interviews. In
								general, these interviews can be conducted by the admissions
								committee or can be alumni interviews.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our students keep reaching
								this stage. We have a list of questions that students are being
								asked from a large no. of popular business school. We offer you
								mock rounds and provide some great interview tips.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 9:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> FINAL DECISION</strong>. Collect admission offers and
								keep an eye on the deadline to accept or decline the admission.
								Plan your next move (visa process, accommodation, etc.)

								We help you finalize the right test dates and register for the
								same. We help you with shortlisting the right Business Schools
								in Canada concurrently providing you reasons on why you should
								select the specific MBA programs.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 3:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong><u>POPULATE</u></strong> the admission requirements
								including essay questions (or SOP requirement) for each
								University and <strong><u>COLLECT</u></strong> admission
								documents that include <strong>sealed transcript</strong> (from
								your degree college – as many copies as the number of
								Universities you are applying to), <strong>recommendation
									letters</strong> (check STEP 4 below), <strong>CV</strong> (updated), <strong>passport
									copy</strong> (scan – front and last page), <strong>marksheets</strong>
								(all – scan them, may be required at a later date), w<strong>ork
									experience letter (s)</strong>, etc. Check out the full list of
								documents required for applying to Canadian Universities.
							</p>
							<h4>Our help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
								We will populate the requirement for each MBA program that you
								are applying to and will submit it to you in the form of a grid
								for easy viewing with options to keep updating the file.
								Information includes Graduate Admission Link, Online Application
								Link, Deadlines, No. of LORs needed, <a
									href="gmat" target="_blank">GMAT</a>/<a
									href="toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a>
								Codes, Address to post any document, Essay questions, SOP
								requirements, and anything that we feel will be very useful to
								you – saving your time and energy (so that you could concentrate
								more on your main admission process). We will check all the
								documents you are collecting or answer any queries that you keep
								having during the process. Our counselors will provide the
								requisite formats / samples of CV, SOP, essays, LORs, etc. We
								also help you with your credential evaluation (WES).
							</p>
							<h4>Note on Credential Evaluation:</h4>
							<p>Some universities may ask for an “academic credential
								evaluation” or a “course by course evaluation”. This needs to be
								done through WES, as required by the university. You will have
								to send your academic documents to these bodies who, for a fee
								of between CAD$ 245, will convert your scores to the Canadian
								Grading system. They will then report these scores to the
								universities you ask them to for an additional fee.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 4:</h3>
							<p>
								Begin <strong>ONLINE</strong> or <strong>PAPER</strong>
								Applications for each University. <strong>REGISTER</strong> your
								referees online and/or collect the recommendation letters (on
								the letter headed paper of the Company / Institution). Most top
								Canadian B-Schools prefer online method of submitting
								recommendations. You will need to register each referee (using
								their company / institutional email – no yahoo, gmail or
								outlook) and your referees will receive an email with
								instructions to submit the recommendation letter online. Through
								your online application portal, you will be able to see if your
								referee has ‘started&#8217; with the recommendation submission or has
								‘completed&#8217; the recommendation letter submission process.
							</p>
							<h4>Our help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We assist you in filling the
								application forms correctly. We discuss on who should be the
								right referee based on your profile, work undertaken at your
								organization (s), etc. Our experts edit any content that you
								wish us to look at. We check your forms thoroughly and explain
								the plan of action that you need to follow for each University
								application submission.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 5:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> WRITE</strong> your <strong>ESSAYS</strong> or Personal
								Statement. Each University may ask you to write from 1 to 4
								essays. Thus, if you are applying to 8 #BSchools you may end up
								writing about 18 to 24 essays. Many Universities also have video
								interviews, or creative essays (eg. PPT presentation). Essay
								writing will be the longest process. Top MBA programs are very
								keen on knowing YOU well and the better the content of essays,
								the better are your chances of admissions to your dream MBA
								program.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We do limitless iterations to
								the essays. Every essay is checked, reviewed, edited, or
								suggested content is discussed. We keep brainstorming with you.
								Ask any of our students and they will say we help you bring out
								crisp and the finest essays. Canadian essay editing is a two way
								process. You keep sending us the essays and we keep reviewing
								them critically. For creative essays, we come with ideas and
								guide you through the process of creating them. For video
								interviews, we provide mock sessions (over skype, facetime or
								face-to-face). We also help you with your scholarship essay and
								application!</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 6:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> Check</strong> and <strong>SUBMIT</strong> each
								application before the deadline. Your referees should also
								submit their recommendations before the application deadline. <strong>REPORT</strong>
								your <a href="gmat" target="_blank">GMAT</a>
								and <a href="toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a>
								or <a href="ielts" target="_blank">IELTS</a>
								scores online through the testing agencies (eg. ETS, Britsh
								Council, IDP, Pearson Vue). Your Canadian BSchool should receive
								the online score report before the application deadline. <strong>POST</strong>
								your transcript and other necessary documents to the right
								address. (some Universities do not require anything to be
								couriered to them until they have made a decision)
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We check your application,
								find errors (if any) and help you correct them and suggest you
								on the next steps after the submissions. We help you report your
								scores online. We check your documents before they are
								dispatched to the University.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 7:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> FOLLOW UP</strong> with the Universities and ensure
								that they have received your documents and that nothing is
								missing. SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION – some Canadian Universities
								need you to finish a separate scholarship application; so keep
								an eye on it and keep searching for opportunities.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At this stage, it is important
								to keep an eye on your emails and application portals as
								sometimes you may be missing some information. We help you solve
								any issues that come up. Our experts will help you with any
								scholarship or funding applications at this stage. We keep
								sharing any useful information or opportunities that come up.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 8:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> INTERVIEWS</strong>. This is your final step before
								receiving an acceptance or rejection. Most top MBA programs
								require you to attend an interview, which could be over skype,
								telephone call, or sometimes in-country personal interviews. In
								general, these interviews can be conducted by the admissions
								committee or can be alumni interviews.
							</p>
							<h3>Our Help:</h3>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our students keep reaching
								this stage. We have a list of questions that students are being
								asked from a large no. of popular business school. We offer you

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 9:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> FINAL DECISION</strong>. Collect admission offers and
								keep an eye on the deadline to accept or decline the admission.
								Plan your next move (visa process, accommodation, etc.)
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is a very important
								stage. The dilemma is when you get more than one admission
								offer. Our students generally do and we get in to the discussion
								about which should be the best option considering all the
								factors (including the changes that happened since you started
								your MBA applications to the current time)</p>

								sessions in case there is an interview call and thoroughly
								prepare you for the visa application and interview.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>Step 13:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> BOOK</strong> accommodation, flight tickets, buy forex,
								do your travel insurance, do the required vaccinations if any
								(your university will have sent you this information about the
								required vaccinations)
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We guide you as much as

								<strong> FLY</strong>. Once you receive the visa, celebrate, buy
								your stuff, pack your bags, and fly.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will provide a
								pre-departure brief (eg. what to carry when you are going, about

							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<p>Your School counsellor or (Junior) College counsellor

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 4:</h3>
							<p>
								Begin <strong><u>ONLINE</u></strong> or <strong><u>PAPER</u></strong>
								Applications for each University. <strong><u>REGISTER</u></strong>
								your referees online and/or collect the recommendation letters
								(on the letter headed paper of the Company / Institution). Most
								Canadian Universities prefer the online method of submitting
								recommendations. You will need to register each referee (using
								their company / institutional email – no yahoo, gmail or
								outlook) and your referees will receive an email with
								instructions to submit the recommendation letter online. Through
								your online application portal, you will be able to see if your
								referee has ‘<u>started</u>&#8217; with the recommendation submission
								or has ‘<u>completed</u>&#8217; the recommendation letter submission
								process.
							</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>Typically, you will be looking at the following methods
								of freshmen applications to Canadian Universities:</h3>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>COMMON APPLICATION</strong> through OUAC. The
									Ontario Universities&#8217; Application Centre (OUAC) can be
									used to submit undergraduate application to Ontario
									universities. The OUAC is operated by the Council of Ontario
									Universities (COU) to facilitate the process of applying to
									first-year undergraduate programs (bachelor&#8217;s degrees)
									and to advanced standing in these programs. Each school is
									completely autonomous in reaching its own admission decisions,
									with the OUAC providing only the application processing
									service.</li>
								<li><strong>DIRECT </strong>standalone online applications
									where you will apply separately and not through any Common App
									System to Universities like University of Saskatchewan,
									University of Manitoba and many more. All College accept direct
									online applications and in few case paper applications sent as
									scanned copies.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h4>Our help:</h4>

								you wish us to look at. We check your forms thoroughly and
								explain the plan of action that you need to follow for each
								University application submission</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 5:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong><u>WRITE</u></strong> your <strong>ESSAYS
									and/or PERSONAL STATEMENT (or STATEMENT OF PURPOSE)</strong>. Each
								University and College may ask you to write either an SOP or up
								to 3-4 essays (topical). Thus, if you are applying to 8 Canada
								Universities and Colleges you may end up customizing about 18 to
								24 essay statements. Essay writing will be the longest process.
								Top Canadian Universities and Colleges are very keen on knowing
								YOU well and the better the content of essays, the better are
								your chances of admissions to your dream Canadian University/
								College for pursuing your undergraduate study in CANADA.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>

								your <a href="ielts" target="_blank">IELTS</a>
								or <a href="toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a>
								scores through the testing agencies. Your selected Canadian
								University/College should receive the score report before the
								application deadline. <strong><u>POST</u></strong> your
								transcript and other necessary documents to the right address
								(some Universities and most of the colleges do not require
								anything to be couriered to them until they have made a
								decision)

								they have received your documents and that nothing is missing. <strong>SCHOLARSHIP
									APPLICATION</strong> – some Canadian Universities need you to finish a
								separate scholarship application; so keep an eye on it and keep
								searching for opportunities
							</p>

							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At this stage, it is important
								to keep an eye on your emails and application portals as
								sometimes you may be missing some information. Our experts help
								you solve any issues that come up. The counselors at ILW help
								you with any scholarship or funding applications at this stage.
								We keep sharing any useful information or opportunities that
								come up</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 8:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> INTERVIEWS. </strong>In rarest of circumstances you may
								receive an intimation for an Interview. This is your final step
								before receiving an acceptance or rejection. Few top Canadian
								Universities may require you to attend an interview over skype
								or through a telephone call, or sometimes in-country personal
								interviews conducted by their Alumni. In general, these
								interviews can be conducted by the admissions committee or can
								be informal alumni interviews

								also help you with your credential evaluation (WES).
							</p>
							<h4>Note on Credential Evaluation:</h4>
							<p>Some universities may ask for an “academic credential
								evaluation” or a “course by course evaluation”. This needs to be
								done through WES, as required by the university. You will have
								to send your academic documents to these bodies who, for a fee
								of between CAD$ 245, will convert your scores to the Canadian
								Grading system. They will then report these scores to the
								universities you ask them to for an additional fee.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 4:</h3>
							<p>
								Begin <strong>ONLINE</strong> or <strong>PAPER</strong>
								Applications for each University. <strong>REGISTER</strong> your
								referees online and/or collect the recommendation letters (on
								the letter headed paper of the Company / Institution). Most top
								Canadian B-Schools prefer online method of submitting
								recommendations. You will need to register each referee (using
								their company / institutional email – no yahoo, gmail or
								outlook) and your referees will receive an email with
								instructions to submit the recommendation letter online. Through
								your online application portal, you will be able to see if your
								referee has ‘started&#8217; with the recommendation submission or has
								‘completed&#8217; the recommendation letter submission process.

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 5:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> WRITE</strong> your <strong>ESSAYS</strong> or Personal
								Statement. Each University may ask you to write from 1 to 4
								essays. Thus, if you are applying to 8 #BSchools you may end up
								writing about 18 to 24 essays. Many Universities also have video
								interviews, or creative essays (eg. PPT presentation). Essay
								writing will be the longest process. Top MBA programs are very
								keen on knowing YOU well and the better the content of essays,
								the better are your chances of admissions to your dream MBA
								program.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We do limitless iterations to
								the essays. Every essay is checked, reviewed, edited, or

								Ask any of our students and they will say we help you bring out
								crisp and the finest essays. Canadian essay editing is a two way
								process. You keep sending us the essays and we keep reviewing
								them critically. For creative essays, we come with ideas and
								guide you through the process of creating them. For video
								interviews, we provide mock sessions (over skype, facetime or
								face-to-face). We also help you with your scholarship essay and
								application!</p>

								or <a href="ielts" target="_blank">IELTS</a>
								scores online through the testing agencies (eg. ETS, Britsh
								Council, IDP, Pearson Vue). Your Canadian BSchool should receive
								the online score report before the application deadline. <strong>POST</strong>
								your transcript and other necessary documents to the right
								address. (some Universities do not require anything to be
								couriered to them until they have made a decision)

							<h3>STEP 7:</h3>

							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 3:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong><u>POPULATE</u></strong> the admission requirements
								including essay questions (or SOP requirement) for each
								University and <strong><u>COLLECT</u></strong> admission
								documents that include <strong>sealed transcript</strong> (from
								School or Junior College – as many copies as the number of
								Universities you are applying to), <strong>recommendation
									letters</strong> (check STEP 4 below), <strong>CV</strong> (updated), <strong>passport

								– saving your time and energy (so that you could concentrate
								more on your main admission process and School/College
								education). Our experts check all the documents you are
								collecting or answer any queries that you keep having during the
								process. ILW will provide the requisite formats / samples of CV,

							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<p>Your School counsellor or (Junior) College counsellor
								upload / update your School reports, predicted grades,
								recommendation, etc. You must however ensure that you are well
								within deadlines and you leave enough time for your school
								counsellor to finish the process.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 4:</h3>
							<p>
								Begin <strong><u>ONLINE</u></strong> or <strong><u>PAPER</u></strong>
								Applications for each University. <strong><u>REGISTER</u></strong>
								your referees online and/or collect the recommendation letters
								(on the letter headed paper of the Company / Institution). Most
								Canadian Universities prefer the online method of submitting
								recommendations. You will need to register each referee (using
								their company / institutional email – no yahoo, gmail or
								outlook) and your referees will receive an email with
								instructions to submit the recommendation letter online. Through
								your online application portal, you will be able to see if your
								referee has ‘<u>started</u>&#8217; with the recommendation submission
								or has ‘<u>completed</u>&#8217; the recommendation letter submission
								process.
							</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>Typically, you will be looking at the following methods
								of freshmen applications to Canadian Universities:</h3>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>COMMON APPLICATION</strong> through OUAC. The
									Ontario Universities&#8217; Application Centre (OUAC) can be
									used to submit undergraduate application to Ontario
									universities. The OUAC is operated by the Council of Ontario
									Universities (COU) to facilitate the process of applying to
									first-year undergraduate programs (bachelor&#8217;s degrees)
									and to advanced standing in these programs. Each school is
									completely autonomous in reaching its own admission decisions,
									with the OUAC providing only the application processing
									service.</li>
								<li><strong>DIRECT </strong>standalone online applications
									where you will apply separately and not through any Common App
									System to Universities like University of Saskatchewan,
									University of Manitoba and many more. All College accept direct
									online applications and in few case paper applications sent as
									scanned copies.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>

							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 5:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong><u>WRITE</u></strong> your <strong>ESSAYS
									and/or PERSONAL STATEMENT (or STATEMENT OF PURPOSE)</strong>. Each
								University and College may ask you to write either an SOP or up
								to 3-4 essays (topical). Thus, if you are applying to 8 Canada
								Universities and Colleges you may end up customizing about 18 to
								24 essay statements. Essay writing will be the longest process.
								Top Canadian Universities and Colleges are very keen on knowing
								YOU well and the better the content of essays, the better are
								your chances of admissions to your dream Canadian University/
								College for pursuing your undergraduate study in CANADA.

								University/College should receive the score report before the

							<h2>Masters Admission Process for CANADA</h2>
							<h3>STEP 1:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> RESEARCH</strong> on and <strong>SHORTLIST</strong>
								your list of Canadian Universities for your selected area of
								interest/major. For a list of MS programs you can study in
								CANADA, check out our <a
									href="ms_in_canada">MS in
									CANADA</a> section
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will help you shortlist the
								right MS programs at the right CANADA Universities based on your
								interest area, career plan, short and long-term goals, current
								academic background and scores, budget, more. We provide a list
								of AMBITIOUS, MODERATE and SAFE Universities for you to select
								from and help you finalize the last list of 8 (sometimes 10)
								CANADA Universities</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 2:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> BOOK TEST DATES</strong> for your <a
									href="gre" target="_blank">GRE</a> if
								required by the University and <a
									href="toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a> or <a
									href="ielts" target="_blank">IELTS</a>.
								Generally, students do the research on schools after knowing
								their <a href="gre" target="_blank">GRE</a>
								score. We recommend you do it the other way round. Ideally, your
								<a href="gre" target="_blank">GRE</a>
								preparation should go alongside your University shortlisting.
								Learn it all here about <a href="gre"
									target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRE</a> , <a
									href="toefl" target="_blank"
									rel="noopener noreferrer">TOEFL</a> and <a
									href="ielts" target="_blank"
									rel="noopener noreferrer">IELTS</a>
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We coach you for these tests.
								We help you finalize the right test dates and register for the
								same. Our experts help you with shortlisting the right
								Universities concurrently.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 3:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> POPULATE</strong> the admission requirements including
								essay questions (or SOP requirement) for each University and <strong>COLLECT</strong>
								admission documents that include sealed transcript (from your
								degree college – as many copies as the number of Universities
								you are applying to), <strong>recommendation letters</strong>
								(check STEP 4 below), <strong>CV</strong> (updated), <strong>passport
									copy</strong> (scan – front and last page), <strong>marksheets</strong>
								(all – scan them, may be required at a later date), <strong>work
									experience letter</strong> (s), etc. Many Canadian Universities now even
								ask for a credential evaluation (WES evaluation). <a
									href="application_requirements_documents_canada">Check
									out the full list of documents required for applying to CANADA
									Universities</a>
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
								We will populate the requirement for each University that you
								are applying to and will submit it to you in the form of a grid
								for easy viewing with options to keep updating the file.
								Information includes Graduate Admission Link, Online Application
								Link, Deadlines, No. of LORs needed, <a
									href="gmat" target="_blank">GMAT</a>/<a
									href="toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a>
								Codes, Address to post any document, Essay questions, SOP
								requirements (each University will want to see some specific
								information in your SOP), and anything that we feel will be very
								useful to you – saving your time and energy (so that you could
								concentrate more on your main admission process). Also, we will
								check all the documents you are collecting or answer any queries
								that you keep having during the process. And then we provide the
								requisite formats / samples of CV, SOP, essays, LORs, etc. . ILW
								also helps you with your WES evaluation.
							</p>
							<h4>Note on Credential Evaluation:</h4>
							<p>Some universities may ask for an “academic credential
								evaluation” or a “course by course evaluation”. This needs to be
								done through WES, as required by the university. You will have
								to send your academic documents to these bodies who, for a fee
								of between CAD$ 245, will convert your scores to the Canadian
								Grading System. They will then report these scores to the
								universities you ask them to for an additional fee.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 4:</h3>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>
								Begin <strong><u>ONLINE</u></strong> or <strong><u>PAPER</u></strong>
								Applications for each University. <strong><u>REGISTER</u></strong>
								your referees online and/or collect the recommendation letters
								(on the letter headed paper of the Company / Institution). Most
								Canadian Universities prefer the online method of submitting
								recommendations. You will need to register each referee (using
								their company / institutional email – no yahoo, gmail or
								outlook) and your referees will receive an email with
								instructions to submit the recommendation letter online. Through
								your online application portal, you will be able to see if your
								referee has ‘<u>started</u>&#8217; with the recommendation submission
								or has ‘<u>completed</u>&#8217; the recommendation letter submission
								process.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We assist you in filling the
								application forms correctly. The counselors discuss on who
								should be the right referee based on your profile, work
								undertaken at your organization (s), etc. Our experts edit any
								content that you wish us to look at. ILW checks your forms
								thoroughly and explain the plan of action that you need to
								follow for each University application submission.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 5:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong><u>WRITE</u></strong> your <strong>PERSONAL
									STATEMENT (or STATEMENT OF PURPOSE)</strong> and/or <strong><u>ESSAYS</u></strong>.
								Each University may ask you to write either an SOP or up to 3
								essays. Some Universities may want you to submit an <strong>Academic
									Statement as well as a Personal Statement</strong>. Thus, if you are
								applying to 8 Canadian Universities you may end up customizing
								about 12 to 14 statements. Few Universities also have video
								interviews. Essay writing will be the longest process. Top MS
								programs are very keen on knowing YOU well and the better the
								content of essays, the better are your chances of admissions to
								your dream Canadian University for pursuing your Masters in
								CANADA.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We do limitless iterations to
								the Statement of Purpose (SOP), Personal Statement, Academic
								Statement or Essays. Every statement is checked, reviewed,
								edited, or suggested content is discussed. We help you customize
								it for each University. We keep brainstorming with you. Ask any
								of our students and they will say we help you bring out crisp
								and the finest essays. Canadian essay editing is a two way
								process. You keep sending us the essays and we keep reviewing
								them critically. We come with ideas and guide you through the
								process of creating them. For video interviews, we provide mock
								sessions (over skype, facetime or face-to-face). We also help
								you with your scholarship essay and application!</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 6:</h3>
							<p>
								Check and <strong><u>SUBMIT</u> </strong>each application before
								the deadline. Your referees should also submit their
								recommendations before the application deadline. <strong><u>REPORT</u></strong>
								your <a href="gre" target="_blank">GRE</a>
								and <a href="toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a>
								/ <a href="ielts" target="_blank">IELTS</a>
								scores online through the testing agencies (eg. ETS, British
								Council, IDP). Your selected Canadian University should receive
								the online score report before the application deadline. <strong><u>POST</u></strong>
								your transcript and other necessary documents to the right
								address (some Universities do not require anything to be
								couriered to them until they have made a decision)
							</p>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
								<strong>Our Help</strong>: We check your application, find
								errors (if any) and help you correct them and suggest you on the
								next steps after the submissions. Our experts will help you
								report your scores online. We check your documents before they
								are dispatched to the University.
							</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 7:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>FOLLOW UP</strong> with the Universities and ensure that
								they have received your documents and that nothing is missing. <strong>SCHOLARSHIP
									APPLICATION</strong> – some Canadian Universities need you to finish a
								separate scholarship application; so keep an eye on it and keep
								searching for opportunities.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At this stage, it is important
								to keep an eye on your emails and application portals as
								sometimes you may be missing some information. ILW helps you
								solve any issues that come up. Our experts help you with any
								scholarship or funding applications at this stage. The
								counselors at ILW keep sharing any useful information or
								opportunities that come up.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 8:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> INTERVIEWS. </strong>This is your final step before
								receiving an acceptance or rejection. While many Canadian
								Universities for MS programs do not require an interview, few
								top Universities for Canadian Universities require you to attend
								an interview over skype or through a telephone call, or
								sometimes in-country personal interviews. In general, these
								interviews can be conducted by the admissions committee or can
								be alumni interviews.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our students keep reaching
								this stage. We have a list of questions that students are being
								asked from a large no. of popular Canadian Universities. ILW
								offers you mock rounds and provide some great interview tips.</p>
							<h3>STEP 9:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>FINAL DECISION</strong>. Collect admission offers and
								keep an eye on the deadline to accept or decline the admission.
								Plan your next move (visa process, accommodation, etc.)
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is a very important

								offer. Our students generally do and we get in to the discussion

								factors (including the changes that happened since you started
								your MS applications to the current time)</p>

								University/College will want to see some specific information in
								your SOP), and anything that we feel will be very useful to you
								– saving your time and energy (so that you could concentrate
								more on your main admission process and School/College
								education). Our experts check all the documents you are
								collecting or answer any queries that you keep having during the
								process. ILW will provide the requisite formats / samples of CV,
								SOP, essays, LORs, etc.</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<p>Your School counsellor or (Junior) College counsellor
								upload / update your School reports, predicted grades,
								recommendation, etc. You must however ensure that you are well
								within deadlines and you leave enough time for your school
								counsellor to finish the process.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 4:</h3>
							<p>
								Begin <strong><u>ONLINE</u></strong> or <strong><u>PAPER</u></strong>
								Applications for each University. <strong><u>REGISTER</u></strong>
								your referees online and/or collect the recommendation letters
								(on the letter headed paper of the Company / Institution). Most
								Canadian Universities prefer the online method of submitting
								recommendations. You will need to register each referee (using
								their company / institutional email – no yahoo, gmail or
								outlook) and your referees will receive an email with
								instructions to submit the recommendation letter online. Through
								your online application portal, you will be able to see if your
								referee has ‘<u>started</u>&#8217; with the recommendation submission
								or has ‘<u>completed</u>&#8217; the recommendation letter submission
								process.
							</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>Typically, you will be looking at the following methods
								of freshmen applications to Canadian Universities:</h3>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>COMMON APPLICATION</strong> through OUAC. The
									Ontario Universities&#8217; Application Centre (OUAC) can be
									used to submit undergraduate application to Ontario
									universities. The OUAC is operated by the Council of Ontario
									Universities (COU) to facilitate the process of applying to
									first-year undergraduate programs (bachelor&#8217;s degrees)
									and to advanced standing in these programs. Each school is
									completely autonomous in reaching its own admission decisions,
									with the OUAC providing only the application processing
									service.</li>
								<li><strong>DIRECT </strong>standalone online applications
									where you will apply separately and not through any Common App
									System to Universities like University of Saskatchewan,
									University of Manitoba and many more. All College accept direct
									online applications and in few case paper applications sent as
									scanned copies.</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You can see above that the
								process is tedious. Our application grid, timelines that we
								prepare for you all help you in ensuring that you are not
								missing on any deadlines. We assist you in filling the
								application forms correctly. Our experts discuss on who should
								be the right referee based on your profile, work undertaken at
								your organization (s), etc. Our experts edit any content that
								you wish us to look at. We check your forms thoroughly and
								explain the plan of action that you need to follow for each
								University application submission</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 5:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong><u>WRITE</u></strong> your <strong>ESSAYS
									and/or PERSONAL STATEMENT (or STATEMENT OF PURPOSE)</strong>. Each
								University and College may ask you to write either an SOP or up
								to 3-4 essays (topical). Thus, if you are applying to 8 Canada
								Universities and Colleges you may end up customizing about 18 to
								24 essay statements. Essay writing will be the longest process.
								Top Canadian Universities and Colleges are very keen on knowing
								YOU well and the better the content of essays, the better are
								your chances of admissions to your dream Canadian University/
								College for pursuing your undergraduate study in CANADA.
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We do limitless iterations to
								your Essays, Statement of Purpose (SOP), Personal Statement,
								Academic Statement. Every statement is checked, reviewed,
								edited, or suggested content is discussed. We help you customize
								it for each University. We keep brainstorming with you. Ask any
								of our students and they will say we help you bring out crisp
								and the finest essays. CANADA essay editing is a two way
								process. You keep sending us the essays and we keep reviewing
								them critically. We come with ideas and guide you through the
								process of creating them. We also help you with your scholarship
								essay and application!</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 6:</h3>
							<p>
								Check and <strong><u>SUBMIT </u></strong>each application before
								the deadline. Your referees should also submit their
								recommendations before the application deadline. <strong><u>REPORT</u></strong>
								your <a href="ielts" target="_blank">IELTS</a>
								or <a href="toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a>
								scores through the testing agencies. Your selected Canadian
								University/College should receive the score report before the
								application deadline. <strong><u>POST</u></strong> your
								transcript and other necessary documents to the right address
								(some Universities and most of the colleges do not require
								anything to be couriered to them until they have made a
								decision)
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We check your application,
								find errors (if any) and help you correct them and suggest you
								on the next steps after the submissions. Our experts will help
								you reporting your scores. ILW check your documents before they
								are dispatched to the University and College.</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 7:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>FOLLOW UP</strong> with the Universities and ensure that
								they have received your documents and that nothing is missing. <strong>SCHOLARSHIP
									APPLICATION</strong> – some Canadian Universities need you to finish a
								separate scholarship application; so keep an eye on it and keep
								searching for opportunities
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At this stage, it is important
								to keep an eye on your emails and application portals as
								sometimes you may be missing some information. Our experts help
								you solve any issues that come up. The counselors at ILW help
								you with any scholarship or funding applications at this stage.
								We keep sharing any useful information or opportunities that
								come up</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 8:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> INTERVIEWS. </strong>In rarest of circumstances you may
								receive an intimation for an Interview. This is your final step
								before receiving an acceptance or rejection. Few top Canadian
								Universities may require you to attend an interview over skype
								or through a telephone call, or sometimes in-country personal
								interviews conducted by their Alumni. In general, these
								interviews can be conducted by the admissions committee or can
								be informal alumni interviews
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our students keep reaching
								this stage. We have a list of questions that students are being
								asked from popular Canadian Universities. ILW offers you mock
								rounds and provide some great interview tips.</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 9:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong><strong>FINAL DECISION</strong>. Collect
								admission offers and keep an eye on the deadline to accept or
								decline the admission. Plan your next move (visa process,
								accommodation, etc.)
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is a very important
								stage. The dilemma is when you get more than one admission
								offer. Our students generally do and we get in to the discussion
								about which should be the best option considering all the
								factors (including the changes that happened since you started
								your undergraduate applications to the current time)</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 10:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>PAY</strong> the required deposit as required by the
								University or College
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 60px;">We will help you make this
								crucial decision and also guide you on the financial matters,
								including how to transfer the deposit and getting you a
								confirmation from the University or College</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 11:</h3>
							<p>
								Undergo an upfront Medical by contacting a Panel Physician<strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will give you list of
								Approved Physicians.</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>Step 12:</h3>
							<p>Prepare your financial documents for the Study visa
								application. Book a student visa appointment after 1 week of
								medical procedure. An interview by the Canadian Consulate may be
								required in few cases.</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will help you finalize your
								financial and other documents according to the requirements of
								the study visa, check if they are in order and guide you in
								filling the Study visa form and conduct mock visa interview
								sessions in case there is an interview call and thoroughly
								prepare you for the visa application and interview</p>
							<p>
								<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h3>STEP 13:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>BOOK </strong>accommodation, flight tickets, buy forex,
								do your travel insurance, do the required <strong>vaccinations</strong>
								(your university will have sent you this information about the
								required vaccinations)<strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We guide you as much as
								possible with all of the above</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>STEP 14:</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>FLY</strong>. Once you receive the visa, celebrate, buy
								your stuff, pack your bags, and fly
							</p>
							<h4>Our Help:</h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will provide a
								pre-departure brief (eg. what to carry when you are going, about
								life in CANADA, etc.), help you connect with other students
								going to CANADA. Enough! We can&#8217;t fly for you. But what we can
								surely do is – stay connected!</p>

									text or email. We&#8217;d love to hear from you! </strong>
