										<strong><u>RESEARCH</u></strong> on and <strong><u>SHORTLIST</u></strong>
										your list of US MBA programs. For a list of over 300 US MBA
										programs with their approximate tuition cost and <a
											href="gmat" target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">GMAT</a>

									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our help</strong>: We will help you shortlist the
										right US MBA programs based on your interest area, career
										plan, short and long-term goals, current academic background
										and scores, budget, more. We provide a list of AMBITIOUS,
										MODERATE and SAFE MBA options for you to select from and help
										you finalize the last list of 8 (sometimes 10) MBA programs
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 2:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong><u>BOOK TEST DATES</u></strong> for your <a

										and <a href="toefl" target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">TOEFL</a>
										or <a href="ielts" target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">IELTS</a>.
										Generally, students do the research on schools after knowing
										their <a href="gmat" target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">GMAT</a>
										score. We recommend you do it the other way round. Ideally,
										your <a href="gmat" target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">GMAT</a>
										preparation should go alongside your B-School shortlisting.
										Learn it all here about <a href="gmat"

									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our help</strong>: We coach you for these tests. We
										help you finalize the right test dates and register for the
										same. We help you with shortlisting the right B-Schools
										concurrently providing you reasons on why you should select
										the specific MBA programs
									</p>
								
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 3:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong><u>POPULATE</u></strong> the admission requirements
										including essay questions (or SOP requirement) for each
										University and <strong><u>COLLECT</u></strong> admission
										documents that include <strong>sealed transcript</strong>
										(from your degree college - as many copies as the number of
										Universities you are applying to), <strong>recommendation
											letters</strong> (check STEP 4 below), <strong>CV</strong> (updated),
										<strong>passport copy</strong> (scan - front and last page), <strong>marksheets</strong>
										(all - scan them, may be required at a later date), <strong>financial
											documents</strong> (balance certificate, bank statement, fixed deposit
										copy, affidavit of support or financial declaration form
										provided by the University), <strong>work experience
											letter (s)</strong>, etc. Check out the full list of documents
										required for applying to US Universities.
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our help</strong>: We will populate the requirement
										for each MBA program that you are applying to and will submit
										it to you in the form of a grid for easy viewing with options
										to keep updating the file. Information includes Graduate
										Admission Link, Online Application Link, Deadlines, No. of
										LORs needed, <a href="gmat"
											target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">GMAT</a>/<a
											href="toefl" target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">TOEFL</a>
										Codes, Address to post any document, Essay questions, SOP
										requirements, and anything that we feel will be very useful to
										you - saving your time and energy (so that you could
										concentrate more on your main admission process for USA ).
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will check all the
										documents you are collecting or answer any queries that you
										keep having during the process. Our will provide the requisite
										formats / samples of CV, SOP, essays, LORs, etc. Our
										counselors will discuss on how much finance needs to be shown
										to the Universities. We will discuss on how much finance needs
										to be shown to the Universities. We also help you with your
										credential evaluation (WES or ECE).</p>
									<h4 style="color:#00A8E8">Note on Credential Evaluation in Admission process for
										USA:</h4>
									<p>Some universities may ask for an “academic credential
										evaluation” or a “course by course evaluation”. This needs to
										be done through WES or ECE, as required by the university. 
										You will have to send your academic documents to these bodies
										who, for a fee of between $150-200, will convert your scores
										to the US 4.0 GPA system. They will then report these scores
										to the universities you ask them to for an additional fee.</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 4:</h3>
									<p>
										Begin <strong><u>ONLINE</u></strong> or <strong><u>PAPER</u></strong>
										Applications for each University. <strong><u>REGISTER</u></strong>
										your referees online and/or collect the recommendation letters
										(on the letter headed paper of the Company / Institution).
										Most top US B-Schools prefer online method of submitting
										recommendations. You will need to register each referee (using
										their company / institutional email - no yahoo, gmail or
										outlook) and your referees will receive an email with
										instructions to submit the recommendation letter online.
										Through your online application portal, you will be able to
										see if your referee has <u>started</u>&#8217; with the
										recommendation submission or has <u>completed</u>&#8217; the
										recommendation letter submission process
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our help</strong>: We assist you in filling the
										application forms correctly. We discuss on who should be the
										right referee based on your profile, work undertaken at your
										organization (s), etc. Our experts edit any content that you
										wish us to look at. We keep check your forms thoroughly and
										explain the plan of action that you need to follow for each
										University application submission
									</p>
									
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 5:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong><u>WRITE</u></strong> your <strong><u>ESSAYS</u></strong>
										or Personal Statement. Each University may ask you to write
										from 1 to 4 essays. Thus, if you are applying to 8 #BSchools
										you may end up writing about 18 to 24 essays. Many
										Universities also have video interviews, or creative essays
										(eg. PPT presentation). Essay writing will be the longest
										process. Top MBA programs are very keen on knowing YOU well
										and the better the content of essays, the better are your
										chances of admissions to your dream MBA program
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: We do limitless iterations to the
										essays. Every essay is checked, reviewed, edited, or suggested
										content is discussed. We keep brainstorming with you. Ask any
										of our students and they will say we help you bring out crisp
										and the finest essays. US essay editing is a two way process.
										You keep sending us the essays and we keep reviewing them
										critically. For creative essays, we come with ideas and guide
										you through the process of creating them. For video
										interviews, we provide mock sessions (over skype, facetime or
										face-to-face). We also help you with your scholarship essay
										and application!
									</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 6:</h3>
									<p>
										Check and<strong> <u>SUBMIT</u>
										</strong>each application before the deadline. Your referees should
										also submit their recommendations before the application
										deadline. <strong><u>REPORT</u></strong> your <a
											href="gmat" target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">GMAT</a>
										and <a href="toefl" target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">TOEFL</a>
										scores online through the testing agencies (eg. ETS). Your US
										BSchool should receive the online score report before the
										application deadline. <strong><u>POST</u></strong> your
										transcript and other necessary documents to the right address
										(some Universities do not require anything to be couriered to
										them until they have made a decision)
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: We check your application, find
										errors (if any) and help you correct them and suggest you on
										the next steps after the submissions. We help you report your
										scores online. We check your documents before they are
										dispatched to the University
									</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 7:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>FOLLOW UP</strong> with the Universities and ensure
										that they have received your documents and that nothing is
										missing. SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION - some US Universities need
										you to finish a separate scholarship application; so keep an
										eye on it and keep searching for opportunities
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: At this stage, it is important to
										keep an eye on your emails and application portals as
										sometimes you may be missing some information. We help you
										solve any issues that come up. Our experts will help you with
										any scholarship or funding applications at this stage. We keep
										sharing any useful information or opportunities that come up
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 8:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong> INTERVIEWS. </strong>This is your final step before
										receiving an acceptance or rejection. Most top MBA programs
										require you to attend an interview, which could be over skype,
										telephone call, or sometimes in-country personal interviews.
										In general, these interviews can be conducted by the
										admissions committee or can be alumni interviews
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: Our students keep reaching this
										stage. We have a list of questions that students are being
										asked from a large no. of popular business school. We offer
										you mock rounds and provide some great interview tips.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 9:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>FINAL DECISION</strong>. Collect admission offers and
										keep an eye on the deadline to accept or decline the
										admission. Plan your next move (visa process, accommodation,
										etc.)<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help: </strong>This is a very important stage. The
										dilemma is when you get more than one admission offer. Our
										students generally do and we get in to the discussion about
										which should be the best option considering all the factors
										(including the changes that happened since you started your
										MBA applications to the current time)
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 10:</h3>
									<p>
										PAY the required deposit as required by the University<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: We will help you make this crucial
										decision and also guide you on the financial matters,
										including how to transfer the deposit and getting you a
										confirmation from the University
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 11:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong> I20. </strong>Finish the <strong>I20 request
											form</strong> and send it to the University (online or by post). If
										you have finalized on joining a University that did not
										request for your financial documents during the application
										stage will ask you to send them these documents now
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong> </strong><strong>Our Help</strong>: We help you with
										guiding you on filling the form correctly
									</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 12:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>VISA</strong>. Pay the <strong>SEVIS</strong> fee. <strong>Prepare</strong>
										your financial documents for the F1 visa application. <strong>Book
											a student visa appointment</strong> and apply for the visa<strong>.
											An interview by the US embassy is compulsory. Prepare well</strong>
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help: </strong>We will help you finalize your
										financial documents, check if they are in order and guide you
										in filling the F1 visa form and taking the US student visa
										appointment. We conduct mock visa interview sessions and
										thoroughly prepare you for the visa application and interview
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">Step 13:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong> BOOK </strong>accommodation, flight tickets, buy
										forex, do your travel insurance, do the required <strong>vaccinations</strong>
										(your university will have sent you this information about the
										required vaccinations)
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: We guide you as much as possible
										with all of the above
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3>STEP 14:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>FLY</strong>. Once you receive the visa, celebrate,
										buy your stuff, pack your bags, and fly
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: We will provide a pre-departure
										brief (eg. what to carry when you are going, about life in the
										USA, etc.), help you connect with other students going to the
										USA. Enough! We can&#8217;t fly for you. But what we can surely do
										is - stay connected!

									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">

										<strong>Once you reach safely, do drop us a line of

									<p>
										Check and<strong> <u>SUBMIT</u>
										</strong>each application before the deadline. Your referees should
										also submit their recommendations before the application
										deadline. <strong><u>REPORT</u></strong> your <a
											href="sat1"
											target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">SAT</a> and <a
											href="act" target="_blank" style="color:#00A8E8">ACT</a>
										scores online through the testing agencies. Your selected US
										University should receive the online score report before the
										application deadline. <strong><u>POST</u></strong> your
										transcript and other necessary documents to the right address
										(some Universities do not require anything to be couriered to
										them until they have made a decision)
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: We check your application, find
										errors (if any) and help you correct them and suggest you on
										the next steps after the submissions. We help you report your
										scores online. We check your documents before they are
										dispatched to the University
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 7:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>FOLLOW UP</strong> with the Universities and ensure
										that they have received your documents and that nothing is
										missing. <strong>SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION</strong> - some US
										Universities need you to finish a separate scholarship
										application; so keep an eye on it and keep searching for
										opportunities
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: At this stage, it is important to
										keep an eye on your emails and application portals as
										sometimes you may be missing some information. <a
											href="contact_us">ILW</a> help you solve any
										issues that come up. Also, with any scholarship or funding
										applications at this stage. Regularly, we keep sharing any
										useful information or opportunities as and when they come up.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 8:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong> INTERVIEWS. </strong>This is your final step before
										receiving an acceptance or rejection. Many top US Universities
										require you to attend an interview over skype or through a
										telephone call, or sometimes in-country personal interviews
										conducted by their Alumni. In general, these interviews can be
										conducted by the admissions committee or can be informal
										alumni interviews<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: Our students keep reaching this
										stage. Our experts have a list of questions that students are
										being asked from a large no. of popular US Universities. With
										that we offer you mock rounds and provide some great interview
										tips. And we help you raise the bar!
									</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 9:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>FINAL DECISION</strong>. Collect admission offers and
										keep an eye on the deadline to accept or decline the
										admission. Plan your next move (visa process, accommodation,
										etc.)
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help: </strong>This is a very important stage. The
										dilemma is when you get more than one admission offer. Our
										students generally do and we get in to the discussion about
										which should be the best option considering all the factors
										(including the changes that happened since you started your
										undergraduate applications to the current time)
									</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 10:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>PAY</strong> the required deposit as required by the
										University
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: We will help you make this crucial
										decision and also guide you on the financial matters,
										including how to transfer the deposit and getting you a
										confirmation from the University
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3>STEP 11:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong> I20. </strong>Finish the <strong>I20 request
											form</strong> and send it to the University (online or by post). If
										you have finalized on joining a University that did not
										request for your financial documents during the application
										stage will ask you to send them these documents now
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: We help you with guiding you on
										filling the form correctly
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 12:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>VISA</strong>. Pay the <strong>SEVIS</strong> fee. <strong>Prepare</strong>
										your financial documents for the <a
											href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html"
											target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F1 </a>visa
										application. <strong>Book a student visa appointment</strong>
										and apply for the visa<strong>. An interview by the
											US embassy is compulsory. Prepare well</strong>
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help: </strong>We will help you finalize your
										financial documents, check if they are in order and guide you
										in filling the F1 visa form and taking the US student visa
										appointment. We conduct mock visa interview sessions and
										thoroughly prepare you for the visa application and interview
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">Step 13:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong> BOOK </strong>accommodation, flight tickets, buy
										forex, do your travel insurance, do the required <strong>vaccinations</strong>
										(your university will have sent you this information about the
										required vaccinations)
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: We guide you as much as possible
										through the admission process for USA
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">STEP 14:</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>FLY</strong>. Once you receive the visa, celebrate,
										buy your stuff, pack your bags, and fly
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>Our Help</strong>: We will provide a pre-departure
										brief (eg. what to carry when you are going, about life in the
										USA, etc.), help you connect with other students going to the
										USA. Enough! We can&#8217;t fly for you. But what we can surely do
										is - stay connected!
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong> </strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Once you reach safely, do drop us a line of
											text or email. We&#8217;d love to hear from you!</strong>
									</p>
									<h3 style="color:#00A8E8">
